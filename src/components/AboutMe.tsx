            Hi, I'm Moritz. I can support you as an Interim GM, C-Level Executive, and Venture Advisor, with a focus on Marketing, Operations, Finance and Business Development.
          </p>
          <p>
            I began my career at Deutsche Lufthansa AG, gained hands-on scaling experience at Rocket Internet SE, and went on to found, grow and exit two companies of my own. With over 10 years of experience, I've raised â‚¬7M+ in venture capital, led teams of up to 150 employees, and scaled two ventures from zero to seven-figure annual revenue.
          </p>
          <p>
            Execution-driven, I own strategy and operations end-to-end and can leverage my vast network of domain experts across every critical business function for fast and measurable impact.
          </p>
