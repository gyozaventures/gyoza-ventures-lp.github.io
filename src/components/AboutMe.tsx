            Hi, I'm Moritz. I support corporates and start-ups as an Interim GM, C-Level Executive, and Venture Advisor, with a focus on Marketing, Operations, Finance and Business Development.
          </p>
          <p>
            I began my career at Deutsche Lufthansa AG, gained hands-on scaling experience at Rocket Internet SE, and went on to found and grow two companies of my own.
          </p>
          <p>
            With over 10 years of experience, I've raised â‚¬7M+ in venture capital, led teams of up to 150 employees, and scaled two ventures from zero to seven-figure annual revenue. As a generalist with a strong execution mindset, I take full ownership across strategic and operational functions.
          </p>
